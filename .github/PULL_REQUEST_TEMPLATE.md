Thanks for contributing to Spring Data. Please review the following notes before
submitting a pull request.

Please submit only genuine pull-requests. Do not use this repository as a GitHub
playground.

Security Vulnerabilities

🛑 STOP! If your contribution fixes a security vulnerability, please do not submit it.
Instead, please head over to https://spring.io/security-policy to learn how to disclose a
vulnerability responsibly.

Dependency Upgrades

Please do not open a pull request for a straightforward dependency upgrade (one that
only updates the version property). We have a semi-automated process for such upgrades
that we prefer to use. However, if the upgrade is more involved (such as requiring
changes for removed or deprecated API) your pull request is most welcome.

Describing Your Changes

If, having reviewed the notes above, you're ready to submit your pull request, please
provide a brief description of the proposed changes. If they fix a bug, please
describe the broken behaviour and how the changes fix it. If they make an enhancement,
please describe the new functionality and why you believe it's useful. If your pull
request relates to any existing issues, please reference them by using the issue number
prefixed with #.

The more effort you put into describing your concern, the easier it will be for us to
review and accept them and the more likely we are to do so quickly.
Keep your description focused and avoid excessive summarization or bloated explanations
so that we can quickly understand the essence of your request.

A brief description of what else to consider, make sure that:
- You have read the [Spring Data contribution guidelines](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-build/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc).
- You use the code formatters provided [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-build/tree/master/etc/ide) and have them applied to your changes. 
Don’t submit any formatting related changes.
- You submit test cases (unit or integration tests) that back your changes.
- You added yourself as author in the headers of the classes you touched. 
Amend the date range in the Apache license header if needed. For new types, add the license header (copy from another file and set the current year only).
- Your commits include a Signed-off-by trailer at the end of each commit message to indicate that the contributor agrees to the Developer Certificate of Origin.
