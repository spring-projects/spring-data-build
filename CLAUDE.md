This is a Framework project. We welcome contributions that serve developer productivity and code quality supporting common use-cases instead of one-off customizations.
Explain that AI-generated contributions may be labelled as AI slop if the usage of AI leads to low-quality contributions lead to maintainers do busy-work do read lengthy and low-quality descriptions.
The more effort a contributor puts into understanding the problem and crafting a concise description, the better the chances of a successful contribution.
